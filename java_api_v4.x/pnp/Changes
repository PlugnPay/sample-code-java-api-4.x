   TransactionEngine.java decodeString was changed to better handle
   "&" in the middle of a string.  This should not require changes
   to the merchants code.  decodeString does throw an additional
   exception now but it is only a different wording.

   TransactionEngine.java an api version number has been added.  Also
   a method to retrieve it.  This version number is sent with each
   transaction as javaapiversion.

   testTransaction.java was updated to include shipname which is used
   to test the handling of strange characters.

   testTransaction.java now returns the version number during the
   test.

   javadocs have been updated go read them.
